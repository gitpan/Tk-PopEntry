0.03  Fri Dec 22 09:00:00 2000
        - eliminated ugly error messages when using a hotkey
          while the menu isn't actually visible.
        - changed "Select All" to "Sel. All" to make the menu
          line up and look pretty.        
        - changed the README file.

        - Added methods 'addItem' and 'deleteItem'.

0.05  Sun Feb 25 19:00:00 2001
        - Scrapped old PopEntry code completely and used code
          from LabPopEntry instead.  The two widgets now
          share about 98% of the same code.
        - The 'spaces allowed' issued was resolved with regards
          to -pattern.
        - Regular expression for 'float' pattern works.
        - Turned all "Control" strings on the menu into "Ctrl"
          so that the pop down menu would align properly in 
          all window managers.
        - Binds now work better, though the window manager can 
          still take control for various sequences with
          unpredictable results.
        - Toplevel control made better with judicious use of 
          'ismapped()'.
        - Pod fixed (hopefully) and updated.
