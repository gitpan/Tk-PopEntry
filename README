Tk::PopEntry is a derived widget, based on Tk::Entry.

It includes a pop-up menu that appears automatically when
a user right-clicks on the Entry widget.  There are five
default options: Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete and Select All.

There are also input mask options that can be used to limit
the types of data that a user may enter.

See the README.html file for a full description of this module.
